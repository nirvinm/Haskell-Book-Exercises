Compiling this repository
-------------------------

Each chapter is divided into seperate `Stack` project. All the projects are compiled with Stackage snapshot version `LTS 13.18`. Initial few chapters don't have Stack project setup for brevity. Those chapters contain solutions in individual Haskell files. They can be simply loaded with `GHCI`.


**To load individual Haskell file**

    $ stack ghci <filename.hs>

**To compile Stack project**

    $ stack build

**To load Stack project in `GHCI`**

    $ stack ghci

**To run `QuickCheck` tests**

    $ stack test
